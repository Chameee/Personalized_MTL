# Models in this code:

## Multitask Neural Network 

## Multitask Multi-kernel Learning (MTMKL)

## Hierarchical Bayesian Logistic Regression (HBLR)

# Structure

## Code structure
Wrappers are used to perform a grid search over hyperparameters

## Input data format
### .csv files
Assume csvs have columns for 'user_id', 'timestamp'

### 'Task dict list' 
For the multi-task algorithms, we use a special data structure saved to a pickle file to represent the data from multiple tasks. 

~~ Describe ~~

The code for generating files in this format give a .csv file is available in make_datasets.py
